# The Shoppies

## Hosted On: https://tiffanyluu-the-shoppies.netlify.app/

### In addition to the requirements listed, I improved the design to include:
* ### Movie poster
* ### Saving nominations when the user refreshes the page
* ### Improving the UI by adding color 
* ### Displaying results and nominations as a separate component instead of as a list

I challenged myself to reduce my dependency on Bootstrap for styling, and instead chose to style with CSS only. 
Throughout this process, I have gained a much better understanding of flexbox and responsive design.
